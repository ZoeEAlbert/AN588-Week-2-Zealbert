## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Challenge One
```{r}
v<-c("Stately,","plump","Buck","Mulligan", "came","from","the","stairhead,","bearing","a", "bowl","of","lather","on","which","a","mirror", "and","a","razor","lay","crossed")
##this is a vector of stings from the first line of Ulysses.
v[seq(from = 1 , to = 22, by = 3)]
##Every third element of above vector.  This is something different from the hint, but I believe it still works. 
```
##Challenge Two
```{r}
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
x <- m[,c(2,3,6)]
x

## I struggled to figure out how to get column 6. I can only do 2 and 3 because they are next to each other. 
x <-m [6:8,]
x
##The 6th to 8th row of the matrix. 
x <-m [2:6,2:9]
x
##The elements from row 2:column 2 to row 6:column 9.
```
##Challenge Three
```{r}
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a
##A 4D 400 element array.
a[1, 1, 1, 2]
a[2, 3, 2, ]
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
##3 returns from said matrix. 
```
##Challenge Four
```{r}
Lemuroidea <- c("Cheirogaleidae", "Lepilemuridae", "Indriidae", "Lemuridae",
    "Daubentoniidae")
Lorisoidea <- c("Lorisidae", "Galagidae")
Strepsirhini <- list(Lemuroidea, Lorisoidea)
names(Strepsirhini) <- list("Lemuroidea", "Lorisoidea")
Strepsirhini
##List of Strepsirhini primates. 
Platyrrhini <- c("Cebidae", "Atelidae", "Pitheciidae")
Catarrhini <- c("Cercopithecidae", "Hylobatidae", "Hominidae")
Anthropoidea <- list(Platyrrhini, Catarrhini)
names(Anthropoidea) <- list("Platyrrhini", "Catarrhini")
Anthropoidea
##Anthropoidea, a subset of Haplorhini 
Tarsioidea <- c("Tarsiidae")
Tarsioidea <- c("Tarsiidae")
names(Tarsioidea) <- list("Tarsiidae")
Tarsioidea
##Tarsioidea, a subset of Haplorhini
Haplorhini <- c("Anthropoidea","Tarsioidea")
Haplorhini <- list(Anthropoidea, Tarsioidea)
names(Haplorhini) <- list("Haplorhini")
Haplorhini
##Haplorhini 
Primates <- c("Haplorhini", "Strepsirhini")
Primates <- list(Haplorhini, Strepsirhini)
names(Primates) <- list("Haplorhini", "Strepsirhini")
Primates
##List of all primates
##Feels Overwhelming.  Is there an easier way?
```
##Challenge Five
```{r}
m3 <- matrix(data = c(3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2), nrow = 5, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
m3
##5x3 Row Wise Matrix
df3 <- as.data.frame(m3)
df3
## Now the matrix is a data frame. 
df3[,2] = as.logical(df3[,2])
df3
## Second column is now logical valued.  I am unsure of what this really means. 
df3[,3] = as.factor(df3[,3])
df3
## Third column is now factor valued.  I am also unsure of what this really means. 
str(df3)
##Date type in data frame. 
## I need help with Data Frames. 
```

## Challenges During Homework
## I struggled throughout, as this was a big learning curve, but was elated each time I figured something out.  At the start of the excercize, my main struggles were related to simple things like using ' instead of ` to deliniate a chunk.  A lot of this was figured out with trial and error, as well as google.  
## I had a hard time in challenge two, figuring out how to include a column that wasn't next to the other two columns.  This was potentially figured out via google, but I am going to go to office hours to discuess.  
## I struggled with how many words were a part of challenge four, in that I had a hard time keeping track as I went back and forth.  I am still unsure if there is an easier way to keep track.  
## I think I struggled the most with challenge five. I need help figuring out data frames.
